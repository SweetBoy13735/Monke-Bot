*"Ook, Ook!"*
Monke Bot is an interactive Discord bot that is centred around... Well... Monkes!
Originally incepted as a shit-post between friends on my Game Design & Development course at Uni, we've gone as far as presenting it to our course admins, who've approved its use on the official Discord server.
This repository serves as our boi's official home, where you can view the source code, add the bot to your Discord server, or download a copy for yourself!
